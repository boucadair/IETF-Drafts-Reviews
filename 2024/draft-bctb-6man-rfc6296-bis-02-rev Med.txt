Hi Ole, all, 

Thanks for taking care of this. Please find below some quick comments: 

(1) Update the abstract to indicate that this document obsoletes RFC 6296.

(2) Consider adding a subsection or an appendix with a list of changes vs. 6296 as per this Guidelines "Ensure the I-D clearly summarizes any changes made from the RFCs being updated or obsoleted.". I would list in particular there that erratum https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid3033 was implemented.

(3) Update all IPv6 address examples to be consistent with RFC 5952. 

(4) Section 7: 

4.1. Please note that the "NPTv6 Applicability" section says the following:

   These applications currently require
   Application Layer Gateways (ALGs) to work correctly through NAPT44
   devices, and similar ALGs may be required for these applications to
   work through NPTv6 Translators.
 
   Which may seem to be conflicting with the reco in Section 7. Please reword to avoid internal inconsistency.

4.2. An approach to avoid ALGs is to discover the external prefix used by the NPTv6. A discovery approach is specified in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6887#section-2.1.

(5) Section 8: Add a note as per RFC 7942

   Since this information is necessarily time dependent, it is
   inappropriate for inclusion in a published RFC.  The authors should
   include a note to the RFC Editor requesting that the section be
   removed before publication.

(6) Consider adding some text about the manageability of NPTv6. FWIW, you may refer for the provisioning of NPTv6 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8512#autoid-33)

(7) Update many RFCs as they were obsoleted since then (e.g., RFC 5996, RFC 6204, RFC 5389, RFC 5766, RFC 5245, ..)

Cheers,
Med
